# LifelongGAN Ringer

The code in this repository is my implementation of LifelongGAN algorithm (Lifelong GAN: Continual Learning for Conditional Image Generation) adapted from <https://github.com/ChillingDream/Lifelong-Gan>.

The main objective is create a model that can generate samples with low $\mu$ and high $\mu$ for Ringer developments.
